# Personal ECG

### Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a simple electrocardiograph. However, it should still be
highly accurate and completely safe. Version 1 will be a proof of concept whereas future versions
will emphasize portability, comfort and continuous monitoring. These later versions may require
custom printed parts using a 3D printer.

### Theory of Operation

[The Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiography) provides a solid background
on how an ECG works as well as guides for proper lead placement.
